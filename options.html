			<h1>Guide</h1>
			
			<p>Session Manager is a simple yet powerful extension that makes it quick and easy to save, update, remove, and restore sets of tabs.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Create sessions for daily routines; pages you open in the morning, noon and evening.
				<li>Group pages of common interest such as News, Financial and Social.
				<li>Save pages discovered during a research session that you'd like to revisit later.
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Saving sessions</h2>
			<p>To save a session, enter the name in the textbox in the "Save this window's tabs" area and press enter. A session with that name containing the current window's tabs will be created. If a session with that name already exists, you will be asked to confirm replacing it.</p>
			
			<h2>Temp session</h2>
			<p>The temporary session is a special session that, when the browser is opened, will automatically open and delete itself. Click "as temp session" next to "Save this window's tabs" to save or replace it. Except for renaming, the temp session can be opened and modified like a normal session as described below.</p>
			
			<h2>Session list</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Hover over the tab count to view the url list.
				<li>Click the name of the session and enter the new name to rename it. If the new name is already in use by a session, you will be asked to confirm replacing it.
				<li>Click the little "&times;" to remove the session. You will be asked to confirm the removal.
				<li>Click "Open" while optionally holding modifier keys to open the session. Key+click combo configuration is in the "Opening sessions" options.
				<li>Click "Add" to add the current window's tabs to the session. You will be asked to confirm adding them.
				<li>Click "tab" next to "Add" to add the current tab to the session. You will be asked to confirm adding it.
				<li>Click "Replace" to replace the session with the current window's tabs. You will be asked to confirm the replacement.
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Omnibox</h2>
			<p>Sessions can be opened by typing "session" in the omnibox and pressing the tab or space key, then entering the session name and pressing enter. Session Manager may suggest some sessions based on the text entered.</p>
			
			<h2>Incognito</h2>
			<p>"Allow in incognito" must be checked under Session Manager in chrome://extensions for the incognito features to work. Sessions can be saved and opened normally in existing incognito windows, and can be opened in new incognito windows with the combo in the "Opening sessions" options.</p>
